## ESP32-Spy ##

This is a Simple tool to detect Inputs from a NES or SNES Controller for the ESP32.
Inspired by [https://github.com/jaburns/NintendoSpy](NintendoSpy) i decided to start this little Project.

It uses the GameController Lib from [https://github.com/bitluni/ArduinoGameController](bitluni) .

Current plan is to create a win GUI that is able to show a GameController Overlay and Eventually add more Systems.
